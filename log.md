# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started the Udemy web developer bootcamp.

**Thoughts:** First, I plan to complete the Udemy web developer bootcamp. Next, I want to complete the free LambdaSchool bootcamp [Mini Bootcamp](https://lambdaschool.com/mini-bootcamp/). Finally, I would like to work through [p1xt-guides](https://github.com/P1xt/p1xt-guides) starting with the Job Ready Guide. I'm referencing this dude's [log](https://github.com/jjprevite/100-days-of-code/blob/master/log.md) to create my learning path.

### Day 2: June 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Off to rocky start, but I continued the Udemy web developer bootcamp. Still covering markup, so the material isn't the most exciting, but the teacher does a great job.

**Thoughts:** I'm feeling a bit exhausted since there is a plethora of learning materials out there. I'm hoping to finish the Udemy bootcamp this week since my cohort starts soon and I want to be 100% committed. On a side note, I'm also trying to take better care of my health which always makes learning more enjoyable. Hoping to be **ON IT** this week and note miss a day.

### Day 3: June 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Off to rocky start, but I continued the Udemy web developer bootcamp. Still covering markup, so the material isn't the most exciting, but the teacher does a great job.

**Thoughts:** Learned about file vs http(explicit) protocol when creating links.

### Day 4: June 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the WDB (Udemy Web Dev Bootcamp) 8% complete.

**Thoughts:** I was accepted into Chingu's June cohort–starts June 9th. Read Chingu cohort prep material Trello board, I'm excited to start working with fellow learners.

### Day 5: June 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the WDB (Udemy Web Dev Bootcamp) 11% complete.

**Thoughts:** There is still a ton of WDB material to get through, but this class is definitely teaching me a few things I never fully researched.

**New Learns:** By default if you don't specify a form action it's going to get sent to the current page you are on, just refreshing the page. If you don't specify a method then the form is going to be a get request. There are two ways to structure/connect form labels and inputs.
1. wrap inputs inside of labels
2. connect form labels and input by using for="" on labels and id="" on inputs
Use name attribute on radio button inputs to connect them making a single decision.
If a button element is the last thing in a form, it will actually submit the form.

```html
<!-- There are two ways to use HTML5 password length validation -->
<label for="password">Password: </label>
<input id="password" type="password" required placeholder="your password" pattern=".{5,10}" title="5 to 10 characters">
<!-- Newer and less support -->
<label for="password">Password: </label>
<input id="password" type="password" required placeholder="your password" minlength="5" maxlength="10">
```

### Day 6: June 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the WDB, completing Section: 5 with 15% complete overall.

**Thoughts:** I'm getting close to the JavaScript section of the WDB course which is the material I find the most challenging and exciting.

**New Learns:** Hexadecimal – Base 16 (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F) <br> #_ _ _ _ _ _ first 2 how much RED, how much GREEN, how much BLUE. RGB – 3 channels: RED, GREEN, and BLUE. Each ranges from 0 - 255. RGBA – Just like RGB, but with an alpha(transparency) channel. Ranges from 0.0 - 1.0.

### Day 7: June 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the WDB, completing Section: 5 with 18% complete overall. I signed up for [Chingu FCC Speedrun Challenge](https://github.com/P1xt/chingu-fcc-speedrun-challenge), Tapirs Build to Learn - OPEN project edition, and accountability buddy.

**Thoughts:** I'm excited to begin my Chingu, there is definitely much work to be done.

### Day 8: June 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the WDB, completing Section: 5 with 19% complete overall.

**Thoughts:** I may have to put my WDB course on the back burner and focus on my Chingu tasks.

### Day 9: June 10, 2017

**Thoughts:** I'm gleaning a lot from my fellow Tapirs on Slack.
