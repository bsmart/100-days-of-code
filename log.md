# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started the Udemy web developer bootcamp.

**Thoughts:** First, I plan to complete the Udemy web developer bootcamp. Next, I want to complete the free LambdaSchool bootcamp [Mini Bootcamp](https://lambdaschool.com/mini-bootcamp/). Finally, I would like to work through [p1xt-guides](https://github.com/P1xt/p1xt-guides) starting with the Job Ready Guide. I'm referencing this dude's [log](https://github.com/jjprevite/100-days-of-code/blob/master/log.md) to create my learning path.

### Day 0: June 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Off to rocky start, but I continued the Udemy web developer bootcamp. Still covering markup, so the material isn't the most exciting, but the teacher does a great job.

**Thoughts:** I'm feeling a bit exhausted since there is a plethora of learning materials out there. I'm hoping to finish the Udemy bootcamp this week since my cohort starts soon and I want to be 100% committed. On a die note, I'm also trying to take better care of my health which always makes learning more enjoyable. Hoping to be **ON IT** this week and note miss a day.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
